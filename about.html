<h1>About me</h1>
<hr>
<p>My name is Kevin, 36 years old, i live in the Netherlands, i'm a father of 1 and active in this community since 2023.<br>
I want to learn full-stack development, since i've always had an above average affinity with computers and everything that happens behind the click.<br>
I hope to be a freelancer one day, so i can provide better for my family and hope to have more financial security, and ofcourse more challenges along the way!<br>
